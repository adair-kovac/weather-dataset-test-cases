# Overview

This project is an attempt to compile a number of use cases that can be used to test publicly-archived large weather
datasets.

The goals are to:

- Collect use cases from different research groups, so that when a data model is being developed, it doesn't narrowly
support only the sort of analysis the developing group is familiar with.
- Increase speed and quality of data format conversion projects, by providing test cases that can be
used at critical stages of development and productionization.
- Allow the data archive developers to evaluate the trade-offs involved in their design decisions.
- Enhance community understanding of the pros and cons of different data format and model choices, through providing comparable
test cases by which datasets can be benchmarked for performance and computational resource requirements.
- Facilitate comparisons between different data access patterns and libraries.
- Increase the number of code examples available to those getting started with a new dataset or tool.
